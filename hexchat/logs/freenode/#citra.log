Mar 27 19:58:58 <JayFoxRox>	weird thing 2: now that I've implemented it according to the hw results the games are *still* broken (testing tappingo and crash time 3d - tappingo broken, crash time working but black car)
Mar 27 20:00:09 <JayFoxRox>	thorium wars also short view distance
Mar 27 20:00:49 <mooch>	maybe your formula is wrong m8
Mar 27 20:00:59 <mooch>	maybe you're not taking something important into account m8
Mar 27 20:01:00 <JayFoxRox>	mooch: it was hw tested with only minor details unknown..
Mar 27 20:01:14 <mooch>	those minor details can still make a difference m8
Mar 27 20:01:18 <JayFoxRox>	only remaining thing is early depth testing but that's probably not it
Mar 27 20:01:28 <JayFoxRox>	starting to think yuriks original PR was broken
Mar 27 20:01:53 <yuriks>	the depth write one?
Mar 27 20:02:49 <JayFoxRox>	yeah
Mar 27 20:02:55 <JayFoxRox>	I'll retest those things I guess
Mar 27 20:03:14 <JayFoxRox>	I only need to add an option to scroll through the depth compare modes + add option to move the clear distance
Mar 27 20:06:11 <LokiX>	JayFoxRox: Would this be a depth bug? http://i.imgur.com/I38ZBMe.png (she should be behind that door)
Mar 27 20:06:24 *	uwharrie (~uwharrie@cpe-24-74-57-229.carolina.res.rr.com) has joined
Mar 27 20:09:47 <JayFoxRox>	possibly - and there is a good chance my current change will fix it
Mar 27 20:10:25 <JayFoxRox>	I just noticed some more regs yuriks: GPUREG_DEPTHBUFFER_READ / GPUREG_DEPTHBUFFER_WRITE (afaik your PR only uses GPUREG_DEPTH_COLOR_MASK)
Mar 27 20:10:54 <JayFoxRox>	I'll split all of that into a different test and keep the depth_write test for the actual W-buffer scale
Mar 27 20:10:57 <yuriks>	JayFoxRox: those control access to the framebuffer, I think they're mostly for power gating
Mar 27 20:11:15 <yuriks>	results if you actually do access the buffer with those disabled are glitches iirc
Mar 27 20:11:43 <JayFoxRox>	mhkay
Mar 27 20:11:44 <yuriks>	JayFoxRox: I didn't mess around with those on the test though, so they should be enabled
Mar 27 20:12:06 <yuriks>	I can check EO4 but I'm pretty sure it had them enabled too
Mar 27 20:12:34 <yuriks>	context: the game bug I originally made the PR for is EO4, which disables depth test and then writes a fullscreen quad to clear the depth buffer
Mar 27 20:12:49 <yuriks>	(it draws fullscreen quads instead of doing a GPU clear, for some reason, both for color and depth)
Mar 27 20:16:27 *	uwharrie has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
Mar 27 20:16:39 <mooch>	probably just poor coding
Mar 27 20:17:59 <JayFoxRox>	yuriks: because it's faster - xbox also does it. the CLEAR will usually stall the pipeline and another component is doing it
Mar 27 20:18:26 <yuriks>	yeah, that makes sense, doing a clear is a lot of works compared to just drawing an immediate mode quad
Mar 27 20:18:26 <JayFoxRox>	while pushing 4 verts is really fast
Mar 27 20:18:43 *	uwharrie (~uwharrie@cpe-24-74-57-229.carolina.res.rr.com) has joined
Mar 27 20:18:43 <yuriks>	of work*
Mar 27 20:19:23 <mooch>	oh
Mar 27 20:19:25 <JayFoxRox>	xbox even has to do it iirc because the CLEAR is rather limited in pixel strides etc (similar to the 3DS memory fill stuff), so with some AA modes you are screwed
Mar 27 20:19:40 <mooch>	so it's an optimization then
Mar 27 20:20:24 <JayFoxRox>	yeah and there might not even be a way around it - 3DS for example might not allow clearing zeta (stencil and depth) seperately
Mar 27 20:20:48 <mooch>	that's what zeta is??? o.o
Mar 27 20:20:55 <mooch>	i thought it was just depth
Mar 27 20:21:01 <mooch>	since zeta for z
Mar 27 20:21:14 <mooch>	i know what beta is on nvidia tho
Mar 27 20:21:20 <mooch>	it's a blending factor
Mar 27 20:21:55 <JayFoxRox>	most Z buffers are interleaved with stencil.. xbox one is a bitch though because it is also cleared with raw values + it's compressed too
Mar 27 20:22:06 <JayFoxRox>	*the one in xbox
Mar 27 20:22:20 <mooch>	oh geez
Mar 27 20:22:30 <mooch>	is there any info on the compression scheme?
Mar 27 20:23:05 <JayFoxRox>	afair there is a patent and a presentation - it's a common technique and unless you want to emulate hardware very acurately you don't have to emu it
Mar 27 20:23:26 <mooch>	oh
Mar 27 20:23:28 <JayFoxRox>	there is hardly any raw framebuffer access anyway - it's more of a optimization feature
Mar 27 20:23:39 <mooch>	well, pc emulation of an nvidia card would probably require it
Mar 27 20:23:44 <JayFoxRox>	don't think so
Mar 27 20:23:53 <mooch>	since you can quite easily access the depth buffer
Mar 27 20:24:00 <JayFoxRox>	not the raw one
Mar 27 20:24:08 <mooch>	yeah, but the compressed one
Mar 27 20:24:11 <JayFoxRox>	only the driver could - but even those probably don't use it
Mar 27 20:24:17 <JayFoxRox>	no, you can't
Mar 27 20:24:31 <JayFoxRox>	I'd bet it's only exposed for internal debug tools or something
Mar 27 20:24:40 <mooch>	i mean on ring 0 level
Mar 27 20:24:47 <mooch>	and that's where i'd be emulating
Mar 27 20:25:07 <JayFoxRox>	you *could* - and so would the xbox. however, no software does access it - so don't bother with it..
Mar 27 20:25:14 <mooch>	eh
Mar 27 20:25:24 <JayFoxRox>	just saying you need it if you want to be accurate (but then you'd also require the pixel combiner debug output etc)
Mar 27 20:25:30 <mooch>	i do know that pc nvidia emulation requires very accurate emulation
Mar 27 20:25:43 <mooch>	at least, of pfifo
Mar 27 20:26:01 <JayFoxRox>	that's very far from compressed zeta emulation..
Mar 27 20:26:14 <mooch>	eh, true
Mar 27 20:26:20 <mooch>	but then again
Mar 27 20:26:27 <JayFoxRox>	I guess we could only need it for xbox emu for first party games which do DoF or something on a tight memory budget
Mar 27 20:26:27 <mooch>	all the structures the gpu uses are in vram
Mar 27 20:27:08 <JayFoxRox>	xbox is uma / also GART
Mar 27 20:27:26 <mooch>	i don't believe nv4 uses the gart
Mar 27 20:35:52 <JayFoxRox>	yuriks: wrapping depth writes in if (regs[0x115 /*GPUREG_DEPTHBUFFER_WRITE*/] & 2) { makes tappingo work..
Mar 27 20:37:22 <JayFoxRox>	also very high draw distance in thorium wars
Mar 27 20:38:59 <JayFoxRox>	car in crash time still black but we'll consider that a different issue

Mar 27 21:49:15 <GoTree>	so I've been following the build instructions for citra but all the way up until the configuration in cmake, the CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_SDL2 and CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_QT files are nowhere to be found
Mar 27 21:49:47 <GoTree>	so what do i do?
Mar 27 21:50:34 <JayFoxRox>	those aren't files probably but env params instead? Idk - I just do "cmake ." and "make" (I'm on arch)
Mar 27 21:50:45 *	Joefish has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
Mar 27 21:52:04 <GoTree>	whoops yes they arent files but should be there after following:Click the "Configure" button and choose "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64". When CMake gives you an error, find the CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_SDL2 and CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_QT options on the list and check their respective checkboxes. Click configure again. CMake will now download the required libraries.
Mar 27 21:52:25 <GoTree>	in the steps for building on windows
Mar 27 21:53:38 <LokiX>	GoTree: Did you click configure after ticking them and it didn't download them?
Mar 27 21:55:30 <GoTree>	when i configured they straight up weren't there. source and build locations were both correct so i dont know what to do. I also have the latest version of citra so that's not the problem
Mar 27 21:55:54 <GoTree>	you configure first, then generate
Mar 27 21:56:50 <LokiX>	You need to configure once more, actually. After ticking CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_SDL2 and CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_QT.
Mar 27 21:56:59 <GoTree>	so i wasnt able to generate the .sln file because the two options to look for after configuring werent there
Mar 27 21:58:05 <GoTree>	uggh im reading the thing too hurriedly, but nonetheless i cant tick them because they dont show up, thats my problem
Mar 27 22:01:20 <LokiX>	Version of cmake? After running configure once, it should look like this http://i.imgur.com/WBG9xzw.png then you tick CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_SDL2 and CITRA_USE_BUNDLED_QT and run configure again, and then generate.
Mar 27 22:01:26 *	Mazey has quit (Quit: Yes)
Mar 27 22:02:38 <yuriks>	GoTree: did you install the C++ compiler when installing VS?
Mar 27 22:03:01 <GoTree>	well i have 3.4.3.... do you think that's making the difference? yes i do have the C++ compiler
Mar 27 22:03:37 <yuriks>	you 3.4.3 what?
Mar 27 22:03:51 <yuriks>	CMake?
Mar 27 22:04:06 <yuriks>	well, what does the cmake log say, then?
Mar 27 22:04:10 <GoTree>	3.4.3 of cmake rather than version 3.4.1 like in the picture LokiX posted
Mar 27 22:07:41 <GoTree>	wait i think i found the problem. C++ wasnt the default compiler, but i dont know how to "specify the native compiler"
Mar 27 22:08:40 <yuriks>	???

Mar 27 22:10:36 <GoTree>	when you config for the first time, on the window where you choose which version of Visul studio to use you have the options: use default native compilers, specify native compilers, and 2 more options on cross compiling
Mar 27 22:10:49 *	SF94|Away is now known as SonicFreak94
Mar 27 22:12:44 <yuriks>	leave that on use default
Mar 27 22:12:54 <yuriks>	what is the actual error CMake is generating?
Mar 27 22:14:27 <GoTree>	says error in configuration process
Mar 27 22:14:53 <GoTree>	bottom window says config incomplete but i dont know what could be causing that
Mar 27 22:15:40 <yuriks>	what
Mar 27 22:15:40 <yuriks>	is
Mar 27 22:15:41 <yuriks>	the
Mar 27 22:15:42 <yuriks>	actual
Mar 27 22:15:43 <yuriks>	error
Mar 27 22:15:51 <yuriks>	pastebin the output
Mar 27 22:18:00 <GoTree>	Compiling the CXX compiler identification source file "CMakeCXXCompilerId.cpp" failed. Compiler:   Build flags:  Id flags:   The output was: 1
Mar 27 22:19:04 <yuriks>	that indicates that you don't have the C++ compiler installed
Mar 27 22:19:17 <yuriks>	the VS installer does *NOT* install the C++ compiler by default, you have to select it
Mar 27 22:19:32 <GoTree>	what? i did
Mar 27 22:20:09 <yuriks>	what is printed if you execute "set VS140COMNTOOLS" in a commandline window?
Mar 27 22:22:53 <GoTree>	VS140COMNTOOLS=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools
Mar 27 22:23:21 <yuriks>	try closing cmake and opening it again
Mar 27 22:23:57 <yuriks>	if that doesn't work then maybe try rebooting, maybe the env var didn't get set properly
Mar 27 22:24:27 <GoTree>	alright thanks for your help everyone

Mar 30 02:01:02 <Zaneo>	There isn't a way to test an issue if I don't have that game right?
Mar 30 02:02:09 <einstein95>	You could recode the exact code the game uses to get to the issue and try that
Mar 30 02:04:11 <Zaneo>	Hmm that's a good point I guess I'll look into that
Mar 30 02:06:46 <einstein95>	That was sarcasm
Mar 30 02:07:01 <Zaneo>	Well it's a single instruction that's causing an issue
Mar 30 02:07:26 <einstein95>	But what about the stack and registers at that point
Mar 30 02:08:27 <Zaneo>	It looks like MSRLE isn't being decoded properly, hopefully it just breaks when called stand alone?

Mar 30 13:37:59 <Meeloow>	does citra play that 3ds pokemon game?

Mar 30 13:39:24 <Meeloow>	does anyone have a list of games that fully work?
Mar 30 14:02:03 <xy3_>	pokemo

Mar 30 14:02:33 <xy3_>	not pokemon
Mar 30 14:06:08 <Cruel`>	you just need a loose deifnition of "fully working"
Mar 30 14:16:40 <MathimCaim>	isn't there only one game that "fully works" atm? :P
Mar 30 14:16:43 <MathimCaim>	or two
Mar 30 14:17:11 <LittleWhite>	Cave Story ?
Mar 30 14:18:42 <MathimCaim>	Woah Dave seems to be the only one with 5 stars :P
Mar 30 14:19:26 <MathimCaim>	Nine games though if you are okay with audio/graphical bugs

Mar 30 14:53:26 <Meeloow>	my definition of fully working is that it's at least enjoyable to play, and fully playable to the end
Mar 30 14:53:34 <Meeloow>	sound or minor graphical issues are no problem
Mar 30 14:54:24 <Meeloow>	MathimCaim, is there a list of those 9 games?

Mar 31 12:51:31 <JayFoxRox>	first time I hear about 'bikeshedding' - cool term :) will use it more often probably
Mar 31 12:56:05 <neobrain>	:p
Mar 31 12:56:18 <neobrain>	tbh it's easy to overuse the term, but yeah.. it's handy at times
Mar 31 13:22:00 <Saphiresurf>	Oh, that's hella interesting merry!
Mar 31 13:22:05 <Saphiresurf>	I'll try and backup my save then and bring it over
Mar 31 13:25:48 <merry>	Saphiresurf: according to pcmaker ACNL hangs ingame anyway
Mar 31 13:30:45 <Saphiresurf>	daaaamn
Mar 31 13:30:50 <Saphiresurf>	merry, Do you know where it usually hangs?
Mar 31 13:38:27 <merry>	Nope, ACNL is one of those games I have but I haven't actually tried on citra yet.
Mar 31 13:38:35 <merry>	(heh, I should get round to dumping it at some point)
Mar 31 13:38:58 <merry>	(life-sucking game)
Mar 31 13:39:14 <Saphiresurf>	lmao
Mar 31 13:39:15 <Saphiresurf>	Seriously though
Mar 31 13:39:33 <Saphiresurf>	merry, Looks like I'd have to dump my NAND, generate XORPAD's for it, then decrypt it to get the save I need, too
Mar 31 13:40:02 <Saphiresurf>	It's not looking quite as much of a simple case of just dumping my save through a save manager
Mar 31 13:40:32 <merry>	Saphiresurf: Decrypt9WIP has a NAND dumper that does decryption on the 3DS for you.
Mar 31 13:40:46 <Saphiresurf>	Oh that's perfect
Mar 31 13:41:20 <Saphiresurf>	merry, I've been loving having Decrypt9WIP for this stuff :3

Mar 31 13:54:30 *	SF94|Zzz is now known as SonicFreak94
Mar 31 13:56:49 <neobrain>	merry: I suppose it only dumps a decrypted NAND FAT partition though, right? i.e. no title decryption 
Mar 31 13:56:53 <neobrain>	(not directly, anyway)
Mar 31 13:58:47 <merry>	neobrain: Yeah.
Mar 31 13:59:07 <merry>	Would be neat if it did a deep decryption but that's asking too much I think :p
Mar 31 13:59:19 <Saphiresurf>	heh
Mar 31 13:59:21 <neobrain>	do you happen to know what the easiest way to dump and decrypt all titles on a NAND is currently?
Mar 31 13:59:22 <Saphiresurf>	That would be intense
Mar 31 13:59:34 <Saphiresurf>	Would be awesome though
Mar 31 14:01:17 <merry>	nope I've no idea

Mar 31 14:01:33 <neobrain>	guess it's time to invent nihcrypt
Mar 31 14:01:35 <merry>	probably something to stick on your todo-list, neobrain 
Mar 31 14:01:38 <Saphiresurf>	merry, Do you know if there's a way to boot into the 3DS homemenu as Citra currently is?
Mar 31 14:01:57 <Saphiresurf>	d0k9
Mar 31 14:02:01 <Saphiresurf>	Makes everything I swear to god

Mar 31 14:03:11 <neobrain>	isn't that the guy who rather forked D9 instead of even considering to submit PRs until we asked him to?
Mar 31 14:03:28 <merry>	Saphiresurf: *points at neobrain/Subv* (honestly can't remember which one of you booted the home menu)

Apr 01 23:53:41 <Lioncash>	JMC4789: One of the things I consistently manage to run into on SMS is the initial M swish's ending snapping to the top right of the screen
Apr 01 23:53:41 <JayFoxRox>	I also thought about the moire pattern, so maybe textures parsed poorly and missing projection or something
Apr 01 23:54:04 <JMC4789>	Lioncash, dualcore?
Apr 01 23:54:17 <JayFoxRox>	btw, playing wise I'm fine with tappingo which I recently fixed. I must have spend like 10 hours in it already the last weeks
Apr 01 23:54:22 <Lioncash>	JMC4789: nope
Apr 01 23:54:29 <Lioncash>	I always use single core
Apr 01 23:54:36 <JMC4789>	Lioncash, you must have broke it; I can't reproduce that
Apr 01 23:54:40 <JayFoxRox>	(and I'm playing it with a trackpoint so my finger looks horrible already)
Apr 01 23:55:02 <yuriks>	[19:52:51] <JMC4789> the weirder shit starts to happen even on console
Apr 01 23:55:11 <yuriks>	that smells like someone using floats to keep track of time
Apr 01 23:55:19 <JMC4789>	how many hours would it be?
Apr 01 23:55:40 <yuriks>	would it be for what?
Apr 01 23:55:43 <linkmauve1>	JayFoxRox, heh, I play Dungeon Keeper on a trackpoint. ^^
Apr 01 23:55:46 <JMC4789>	before it starts screwing up?
Apr 01 23:55:50 <yuriks>	that depends
Apr 01 23:55:51 <JMC4789>	if it were floating point keeping track of time
Apr 01 23:55:54 <JMC4789>	rough estimate?
Apr 01 23:56:01 <yuriks>	but, the way floating point works is that values near 0 have higher precision
Apr 01 23:56:04 <JMC4789>	I usually see things getting weird around 6 - 8 hours
Apr 01 23:56:42 <JayFoxRox>	linkmauve1: we should have a usergroup for trackpoint players
Apr 01 23:57:02 <JayFoxRox>	though, I often wish I had a mouse - I'm just too lazy to walk into the living room to get it
Apr 01 23:57:10 <JMC4789>	i know there are some really fucked up vids on youtube
Apr 01 23:57:12 *	ChanServ gives voice to shinyquagsire
Apr 01 23:57:18 <JMC4789>	showing the game going crazy eventually
Apr 01 23:57:25 <linkmauve1>	I don’t own a mouse, I’m sure it would be better but I’m lazy to go buy one.
Apr 01 23:57:51 <yuriks>	JMC4789: 6-8 hours doesn't sound enough for it to start happening
Apr 01 23:58:21 <yuriks>	oh, actually, it is
Apr 01 23:58:42 <JayFoxRox>	then we should have a ~~usergroup~~ supportgroup for that instead: "anonymous too-lazy-to-get-mouse-so-i-am-trackpoint-user"
Apr 01 23:58:49 <yuriks>	[19:58:37] <yuriks> << 21600.0f + (1.0f / 60.0f)
Apr 01 23:58:50 <yuriks>	[19:58:37] <geordi> 21600
Apr 01 23:59:00 <JayFoxRox>	also has the super cool acronym atltgmsiat(p)u
Apr 01 23:59:02 <linkmauve1>	yuriks, my calculations tell me 78h, if it was a 60fps game (I know it is a 25fps one).
Apr 01 23:59:11 <linkmauve1>	Oh.
Apr 01 23:59:38 <linkmauve1>	Interesting.
Apr 02 00:00:23 <yuriks>	I forget how to calculate this properly, so I'm just running an experiment
Apr 02 00:01:40 <JayFoxRox>	yuriks: [19:58:37] <yuriks> << 21600.0f + (1.0f / 60.0f)
Apr 02 00:01:40 <JayFoxRox>	easy fix: static int foo = 0; if (foo++ > 10) { t += (10.0f / 60.0f); foo = 0; }
Apr 02 00:01:43 <JayFoxRox>	;P
Apr 02 00:01:52 <linkmauve1>	Anyway, it’s 4am, time to not waste yet another weekend by being too tired to do anything.
Apr 02 00:02:03 <JayFoxRox>	find the off-by-one and get one for free!
Apr 02 00:02:05 <yuriks>	I think my experiment is lying though
Apr 02 00:02:13 <yuriks>	[20:01:50] <yuriks> { printf("%f", 21600.0f + (1.0f / 60.0f)); }
Apr 02 00:02:13 <yuriks>	[20:01:51] <geordi> 21600.017578
Apr 02 00:02:21 *	ChanServ gives voice to Kitlith
Apr 02 00:02:22 <JayFoxRox>	yuriks: use e for such things
Apr 02 00:02:27 <yuriks>	but it's getting close enough to the point where it starts being wonky
Apr 02 00:02:41 <yuriks>	JayFoxRox: I'm explicitly testing for a frame-sized increment
Apr 02 00:02:48 <yuriks>	linkmauve1: good night, good luck, sleep well
Apr 02 00:02:48 <JayFoxRox>	I've had horrible things happen with %f
Apr 02 00:02:53 <JayFoxRox>	so use %e instead
Apr 02 00:03:01 <linkmauve1>	yuriks, you’d think devs would have started learning not to use floats in such cases. ^^'
Apr 02 00:03:02 <yuriks>	oh, thought you mean e as in epsilon
Apr 02 00:03:16 <JayFoxRox>	yeah, I figured :P
Apr 02 00:03:22 <linkmauve1>	Also, SMS is a 30 or 25 fps game.
Apr 02 00:05:16 <JayFoxRox>	linkmauve1: who uses absolute time anyway? shouldn't a properly written game mostly be able to reset timers once in a while?
Apr 02 00:05:22 <yuriks>	[20:05:06] <yuriks> { float t = 6 * 60 * 60; float advance = 1.0f / 60.0f; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < 60; ++j) { t += advance; } printf("%e ", t); } }
Apr 02 00:05:22 <yuriks>	[20:05:06] <geordi> 2.160105e+04 2.160211e+04 2.160316e+04 2.160422e+04 2.160527e+04 2.160633e+04 2.160738e+04 2.160844e+04 2.160949e+04 2.161055e+04 
Apr 02 00:05:42 <yuriks>	JayFoxRox: I see the word "properly written" getting thrown around a lot ;)
Apr 02 00:08:47 <Zaneo>	Probably not correlated, but I had some funky results using printf with %f on whatever ARM is in the Cyclone V

Apr 05 23:48:00 <polaris->	so my work on the gdbstub for citra came up during a job interview i had just a little bit ago
Apr 05 23:48:30 <polaris->	as well as my work with reverse engineering in general, since it applied to their company (although it's not security or anything related)
Apr 05 23:49:44 <polaris->	it was interesting, and the guy really seemed interested and excited to find someone who was into reverse engineering
Apr 05 23:49:55 <yuriks>	yay :)
Apr 05 23:51:57 <polaris->	i almost gave up on this company too, because the guy was nearly a half hour late for the skype interview
Apr 05 23:53:00 <polaris->	the only bad thing (or good, depending on how you look at it) is i don't think i'll have much, if any, opportunity to work with japanese in the office. so any japanese practice i get would be after hours or on the weekends :(
Apr 06 00:06:55 <bunnei>	polaris-, nice! Hobby projects in general are pretty great to have when looking for a job, and emulation in general is a great resume thing
Apr 06 00:07:21 <polaris->	yeah, i have a few hobby projects on my resume already. plus stuff i did in school
Apr 06 00:08:10 <polaris->	i think the biggest thing that got him interested in my resume was that i have 7 years of "professional" game programming experience on my resume, though. i was clear in my descriptions that i only worked on the localization side of stuff, so preparing things for english text, fixing bugs, etc
Apr 06 00:08:25 <bunnei>	Not only does it cover a huge range of skills (comp eng, OS, RE, etc), but it also has a lot of pretty challenging optimization components
Apr 06 00:08:34 <polaris->	but he was thinking i did more stuff like 3d programming, which would apply to their work, but i suck at that :(
Apr 06 00:09:18 <polaris->	but when i was explaining what i *did* do, and i mentioned reverse engineering, he became really interested in that because they need more people in the office who are skilled at RE apparently
Apr 06 00:09:19 <bunnei>	keep coding on side projects, it really pays off

Apr 07 16:43:19 <Dettorer>	that depends on what you want to do, if you only want the binary you could simply install another version of libpng
Apr 07 16:43:53 <Dettorer>	seems like you just need the 1.2 version
Apr 07 16:44:32 <MachinaeWolf>	think I'll try both versions
Apr 07 16:45:25 <Dettorer>	if you compile citra yourself you shouldn't need this old version of libpng (but then you have to install qtwidgets and qtopengl :p)
Apr 07 16:45:43 <MachinaeWolf>	lol
Apr 07 16:49:05 <MachinaeWolf>	well I'm doing both, 1 version of citra make work better than the other *shrugs*
Apr 07 17:02:29 <MachinaeWolf>	yeah it needed both qtwidgets and qtopengl
Apr 07 17:06:35 <MachinaeWolf>	and cmake command worked but make error'd...
Apr 07 17:08:43 <MachinaeWolf>	Dettorer: http://dpaste.com/20H9J8R
Apr 07 17:10:18 <MachinaeWolf>	yep no binary built
Apr 07 17:10:59 <LokiX>	Version of gcc?
Apr 07 17:12:06 <MachinaeWolf>	I have 4.8.5 and 5.3.0 installed
Apr 07 17:14:10 <LokiX>	Is it using the 5.3 one?
Apr 07 17:18:53 <MachinaeWolf>	think so
Apr 07 17:22:36 <LokiX>	I would double check that it is, std::make_unique was intruduced in gcc 4.9, which would explain the error you're getting if it was using 4.8.5.
Apr 07 17:26:36 <MachinaeWolf>	not sure how to check it let me see if I can figure that out
Apr 07 17:28:45 <LokiX>	MachinaeWolf: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17275348/how-to-specify-new-gcc-path-for-cmake/17275650#17275650
Apr 07 17:29:48 <MachinaeWolf>	ah ok
Apr 07 17:35:58 <MachinaeWolf>	did that still error'd looks about the same
Apr 07 17:37:28 <MachinaeWolf>	well it's a much smaller error but still an error
Apr 07 17:39:22 <LokiX>	Paste it? And I'm guessing you "cmake'd" after setting the exports, right?
Apr 07 17:40:16 <MachinaeWolf>	yes I ran cmake first no problem, make was the issue
Apr 07 17:40:19 <MachinaeWolf>	http://dpaste.com/2YATKQQ
Apr 07 17:43:46 <LokiX>	Try deleting the contents of your 'build' folder and run cmake again. If that doesn't work, I have no idea.
Apr 07 17:46:15 <MachinaeWolf>	well it's taking longer this time, might be working
Apr 07 17:46:58 <LokiX>	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Apr 07 17:49:28 <linkmauve1>	MachinaeWolf, libpng has broken the ABI multiple times between 1.2 and 1.6, so it’s normal not to be able to link against one and use the other.
Apr 07 17:51:35 <MachinaeWolf>	ah, well citra finally built
