Mar 30 21:20:32 <ds84182>	Hey endrift, are you going to merge the new Gameboy stuff into mGBA Android?
Mar 30 21:21:18 <endrift>	Eventually.
Mar 30 21:21:32 <FL4SHK>	GB and GBC debugger will feature a cheat search
Mar 30 21:21:42 <FL4SHK>	and it'll be helpful in hacking GB games!
Mar 30 21:21:47 <endrift>	A lot of stuff needs to be rewritten
Mar 30 21:22:27 <ds84182>	I've already redone half of the frontend to make it a bit more modular
Mar 30 21:28:30 <ds84182>	I'll probably reopen Android Studio and make the project use the new Jack and Jill compilers so I can kill RetroLambda
Mar 30 21:28:48 <endrift>	Oh my god what is ANY of that
Mar 30 21:29:04 <endrift>	you sound like you're over complicating goddamn everything
Mar 30 21:30:49 <ds84182>	endrift: If you don't overcomplicate Android you're going to have a bad time
Mar 30 21:31:01 <endrift>	I think you have that backwards
Mar 30 21:31:20 <endrift>	If you use Android, you're going to overcomplicate things and have a bad time
Mar 30 21:31:41 <ds84182>	...
Mar 30 21:31:58 <endrift>	Android SDKs are shit
Mar 30 21:32:03 <endrift>	Java is that bad.
Mar 30 21:33:57 <ds84182>	endrift: All those changes really do is allow the UI to be changed independently of the backing code
Mar 30 21:34:12 <ds84182>	Which is also exactly what Google now wants developers to do
Mar 30 21:34:31 <endrift>	what you're describing is called MV*
Mar 30 21:34:37 <endrift>	and uhhhh what changed
Mar 30 21:35:12 <ds84182>	I've actually fixed some timing related crashes while moving over to MVP
Mar 30 21:35:24 <endrift>	in what

Apr 01 19:03:52 <Extrems>	It's surprisingly hard to detect a cartridge's size.
Apr 01 19:06:38 <Surkow|laptop>	gba or gbc?
Apr 01 19:06:59 <Extrems>	GBA
Apr 01 19:16:38 <endrift>	yeah, you have to do tricks with comparing previously dumped parts with newly dumped parts
Apr 01 19:17:56 <Extrems>	Ah, I opted for comparing DMA and CPU read.
Apr 01 19:21:29 <endrift>	oh?
Apr 01 19:22:59 <Extrems>	DMA reads out 0x00 or 0xFF.
Apr 01 19:23:43 <endrift>	past the end of the cartridge you mean?
Apr 01 19:23:48 <Extrems>	Yeah.
Apr 01 19:23:54 <endrift>	I did not know that
Apr 01 19:24:01 <endrift>	that explains something I saw though
Apr 01 19:24:29 <endrift>	I figured I implemented it wrong when I thought about how the cartridge interface works
Apr 01 19:24:34 <endrift>	but I never got around to testing it
