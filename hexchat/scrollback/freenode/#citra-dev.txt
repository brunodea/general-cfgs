T 1459549215 18<bunnei18>	"As a side-note, the above comment was meant to be fairly "general" with regards to these kinds of changes... If you're stubbing functions because it helps some games boot, you should only be stubbing those specific functions (with some understanding of the consequence of doing so... As it's quite plausible for games to expect functions to error). You shouldn't just blindly stub every known function to return successfully. If that 
T 1459549219 18<bunnei18>	was the case, can you remove any of the stubs from this PR that were not tested?"
T 1459549693 18<JayFoxRox18>	I think stubbing everyhing is fine - at least it's shown what kind of functions will be necessary - it just has to be clear that the first stub-warning will already "taint" the emulation

T 1459563440 18<JayFoxRox18>	I think hwrast is way more important than the hw renderer for the future of the project

T 1459563511 18<JayFoxRox18>	not only is it useful for porting (= no deps), it's also the reference for things which are otherwise hard to implement in HW :)
T 1459563518 18<yuriks18>	maybe "not caring" is a strong word
T 1459563543 18<JayFoxRox18>	so even if it is slow it's probably enough to generate interest in optimizing and perfecting the hw renderer (be it for porting or new features)
T 1459563563 18<yuriks18>	but it's stuck in this position where it's usefulness for users (usable speed) is directly opposite to it's usefulness for the codebase (simple reference code)
T 1459563657 18<JayFoxRox18>	so? it could get a massive speedup at some point when compiled as a OpenCL kernel or something - also users will certainly appreciate the ability to switch to the sw rast in case the hw renderer fails horribly (it might be rare but I think some features won't be emulated properly in hw for a long long time)
T 1459563686 18<yuriks18>	JayFoxRox: you can't magically speed it up by compiling at an openCL kernel, and that was kind of my point, that optimizing it defeats the point
T 1459563710 18<JayFoxRox18>	ofc you can, why not? if you have hundreds of threads running at once it will be faster
T 1459563730 18<yuriks18>	you'd need to do a lot of refactoring on it first
T 1459563765 18<JayFoxRox18>	not with advances in GPGPU compilers etc. there is a loop in the swrast which hardly does anything else than looping over pixels
T 1459563828 18<yuriks18>	that's fair, I'm over-reacting to my previous experiences with that part of the code.
T 1459563851 18<JayFoxRox18>	I'm still confident that OpenMP alone should speed it up a good bit
T 1459563868 18<yuriks18>	can we still get rid of all the inline lambdas though? :P
T 1459563901 18<JayFoxRox18>	I think they are mostly fine
T 1459563916 18<JayFoxRox18>	at least they keep the code nicely in one spot
T 1459563942 18<yuriks18>	that's a downside in my optinion, since there's no way to get the general picture of what the function is done
T 1459563946 18<yuriks18>	is doing*
T 1459563957 18<JayFoxRox18>	the whole thing should probably be more modular and each function call could have lambdas - I agree on that
T 1459563957 18<yuriks18>	you basically have to pattern match on the structure of the code to find your way around it :P
T 1459564002 18<JayFoxRox18>	I think the flow is very logical - if you know how a GPU pipeline works it's pretty easy. it's all in the correct order and everything where you'd expect it
T 1459564030 18<JayFoxRox18>	it's just a bit hard to see the interfaces from block to block at times. so that should probably be split into functions
T 1459564050 18<JayFoxRox18>	but I wouldn't do the pica_to_gl.h kind of thing for the sw rast and keep the lambdas instead
T 1459564081 18<yuriks18>	what do you mean?
T 1459564096 18<yuriks18>	I don't mean splitting it into files, just making it less of monolithic function
T 1459564104 18<yuriks18>	the lambdas have often been a source of perf problems in the past
T 1459564125 18<JayFoxRox18>	really? how so? aren't they just being inlined properly?
T 1459564148 18<Lioncash18>	Generally if it's a small lambda, yes
T 1459564149 18<JayFoxRox18>	it's a logical consequence that they will be the slowest part of that particular code
T 1459564162 18<JayFoxRox18>	so unless you mean a call overhead it's to be expected
T 1459564186 18<yuriks18>	JayFoxRox: MSVC tends to not inline, and also re-initialized them in loops, especially if you use static for no-capture lambdas that's sub-optimal
T 1459564192 18<yuriks18>	that's mostly been fixed I think though
T 1459564196 18<JayFoxRox18>	99% of what that code does is probably figuring out which state is set and jumping to the correct case, and only a small portion will be spend on actually doing math
T 1459564240 18<yuriks18>	one idea I had before was to pre-fill a function table with pointers at the start before entering the loop and just calling those
T 1459564246 18<yuriks18>	no idea if it would be much faster though
T 1459564258 18<JayFoxRox18>	yeah - it will make the code more complicated though
T 1459564309 18<JayFoxRox18>	all math would have to be implemented in seperate functions :/
T 1459564365 18<JayFoxRox18>	oh but C++ has lambda and std::function
T 1459564400 18<JayFoxRox18>	so it's probably as simple as moving the code out of the loop and wrapping everything in lambdas
T 1459566407 18<archshift18>	std::function is pretty slow, though
T 1459566456 18<archshift18>	...vtables...
T 1459566523 18<yuriks18>	aka function pointers :)
T 1459566527 18<yuriks18>	but pointer chasing, fair enough
T 1459566540 18<yuriks18>	yeah, ideally it's just a function pointer and then you pass the state

T 1459956200 18<Lioncache18>	Seems like an out of date manual

T 1459957456 18<Lioncache18>	Considering the only changes are errata changes, but they don't apply to the v6K
T 1459957750 18<JayFoxRox18>	Lioncache: grabbed the newest version from arm silver now and still has the same pseudocode - but maybe it's not even the right page I'm looking at for that piece of code
