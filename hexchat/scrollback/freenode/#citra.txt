T 1460058180 -18ChanServ-	[#citra] Hi, welcome to #citra! Before asking questions, remember: 1) Please leave if you're using Citra to play downloaded games 2) Don't bug us about particular games working (in particular, Pokemon doesn't work yet) 3) IRC is slow-paced; don't hesitate to ask your question (don't ask to ask), but be prepared that it may take some hours until people reply
T 1460058199 18<Dettorer18>	that depends on what you want to do, if you only want the binary you could simply install another version of libpng
T 1460058233 18<Dettorer18>	seems like you just need the 1.2 version
T 1460058272 18<MachinaeWolf18>	think I'll try both versions
T 1460058325 18<Dettorer18>	if you compile citra yourself you shouldn't need this old version of libpng (but then you have to install qtwidgets and qtopengl :p)
T 1460058343 18<MachinaeWolf18>	lol
T 1460058545 18<MachinaeWolf18>	well I'm doing both, 1 version of citra make work better than the other *shrugs*
T 1460059349 18<MachinaeWolf18>	yeah it needed both qtwidgets and qtopengl
T 1460059595 18<MachinaeWolf18>	and cmake command worked but make error'd...
T 1460059723 18<MachinaeWolf18>	Dettorer: http://dpaste.com/20H9J8R
T 1460059818 18<MachinaeWolf18>	yep no binary built
T 1460059859 18<LokiX18>	Version of gcc?
T 1460059926 18<MachinaeWolf18>	I have 4.8.5 and 5.3.0 installed
T 1460060050 18<LokiX18>	Is it using the 5.3 one?
T 1460060333 18<MachinaeWolf18>	think so
T 1460060556 18<LokiX18>	I would double check that it is, std::make_unique was intruduced in gcc 4.9, which would explain the error you're getting if it was using 4.8.5.
T 1460060796 18<MachinaeWolf18>	not sure how to check it let me see if I can figure that out
T 1460060925 18<LokiX18>	MachinaeWolf: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17275348/how-to-specify-new-gcc-path-for-cmake/17275650#17275650
T 1460060988 18<MachinaeWolf18>	ah ok
T 1460061358 18<MachinaeWolf18>	did that still error'd looks about the same
T 1460061448 18<MachinaeWolf18>	well it's a much smaller error but still an error
T 1460061562 18<LokiX18>	Paste it? And I'm guessing you "cmake'd" after setting the exports, right?
T 1460061616 18<MachinaeWolf18>	yes I ran cmake first no problem, make was the issue
T 1460061619 18<MachinaeWolf18>	http://dpaste.com/2YATKQQ
T 1460061826 18<LokiX18>	Try deleting the contents of your 'build' folder and run cmake again. If that doesn't work, I have no idea.
T 1460061975 18<MachinaeWolf18>	well it's taking longer this time, might be working
T 1460062018 18<LokiX18>	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
T 1460062168 18<linkmauve118>	MachinaeWolf, libpng has broken the ABI multiple times between 1.2 and 1.6, so it’s normal not to be able to link against one and use the other.
T 1460062295 18<MachinaeWolf18>	ah, well citra finally built
T 1460062320 18<MachinaeWolf18>	thanks LokiX
